// We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
    // change code below this line
    arr.splice(0,2,'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond');
    // change code above this line
    return arr;
  } 
   
  // do not change code below this line
  console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));

  /*
  
  with splice() â€” in addition to removing elements, we can use that third parameter, which represents one or more elements, to add them as well. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.
