// In the following code, please import the default export, subtract, from the file "math_functions", found in the same directory as this file.


"use strict";
import subtract from "math_functions";
subtract(7,4);

// The syntax differs in one key place - the imported value, add, is not surrounded by curly braces, {}. Unlike exported values, the primary method of importing a default export is to simply write the value's name after import.
