/*

first, let's cover some functional terminology:

Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.
