// Change the regex haRegex to match the word "Hazzah"
// only when it has four or more letter z 's.

let haStr = "Hazzzzah";
let haRegex = /Haz{4,}ah/; // Change this line
let result = haRegex.test(haStr);

// To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

// For example, to match only the string "hah" with the letter a appearing at least 3 times, your regex would be / ha{ 3,} h /.
